# 📈 Polynomial Regression with SciKit-Learn

## 🏗️ Project Overview
This repository demonstrates polynomial regression techniques using Python's SciKit-Learn library to model non-linear relationships in data. The project focuses on analyzing advertising expenditure data to predict sales performance, showcasing how polynomial features can enhance linear regression models.

## ✨ Key Features
- Implementation of polynomial regression for non-linear data patterns
- Exploratory data analysis of advertising spend vs sales
- Model evaluation and selection process
- Practical application on real-world style dataset

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Polynomial Regression.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis
- `Advertising.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (sales vs TV, radio, newspaper ad spending)

## 💻 Technical Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **NumPy** - for numerical operations
- **Pandas** - for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - for data visualization
- **SciKit-Learn** - for machine learning implementation
  - PolynomialFeatures
  - LinearRegression
  - Model evaluation metrics

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered
- Feature engineering with polynomial transformations
- Understanding model complexity vs performance
- Train-test split methodology
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Model serialization for deployment

## 📝 Results
The polynomial regression model achieved:
- MAE: 0.4896
- RMSE: 0.664
Significantly outperforming simple linear regression on this dataset.

## 🌐 Applications
Polynomial regression is valuable for:
- Sales forecasting
- Market trend analysis
- Financial modeling
- Any scenario where relationships between variables are non-linear
